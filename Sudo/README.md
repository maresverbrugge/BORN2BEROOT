# Sudo

## Subject:
You have to install and configure sudo following strict rules:

To set up a strong configuration for your sudo group, you have to comply with the
following requirements:
• Authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts in the event of an incorrect password.
• A custom message of your choice has to be displayed if an error due to a wrong
password occurs when using sudo.
• Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. The log file
has to be saved in the /var/log/sudo/ folder.
• The TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons.
• For security reasons too, the paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted.
Example:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin

## Install
Sudo does not work by default, so you have to install and configure first:
1. Go to root. If you're logged in as another user than root, use `su` to get to root first. Enter root password.
2. Install sudo with `apt install sudo`.
3. Add user to sudo group with `sudo adduser <username> sudo`. Works when you're in root.
To check if user is in group sudo run `getent group sudo`.
4. Make sure to log out and log in again with `sudo reboot`.
4. `sudo -v` to verify sudopowers.
5. Now you can run root-privileged commands with prefix `sudo`, like: `sudo apt update`.

## Configuration
1. Edit sudo file using `sudo visudo`.
2. Authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts in the event of an incorrect password. Add the line `Defaults   passwd_tries=3`.
3. A custom message of your choice has to be displayed if an error due to a wrong
password occurs when using sudo. Add the line `Defaults  badpass_message="<custom message of your choice>"`.
4. Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. The log file
has to be saved in the /var/log/sudo/ folder. Add the lines `Defaults   log_input, log_output` and `Defaults   iolog_dir=/var/log/sudo/`.
5. For security reasons, the paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted. To set a secure path, add the line ` Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin" `. Most of the line should already be there, you just need to add the very end `:/snap/bin`.
6. The TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons. Add the line `Defaults  requiretty` to do so.
7. Then, change the default sudo log file. By default, sudo logs through syslog(3). However, to specify a custom log file, add the following line: `Defaults  syslog=local1`.
8. Run `sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf` and before the `auth,authpriv.*;local1.none` line add this line: `local1.*  /var/log/sudo/sudo.log`.
9. Restart `rsyslog` by running `sudo systemctl restart rsyslog`.
10. All your sudo commands from now on will be logged in the /var/log/sudo/sudo.log file. To try it out, run something like `sudo echo hellooooo`. Check if it was correctly saved to the log file by running `sudo cat /var/log/sudo/sudo.log`.


### Information on TTY:
tty stands for TeleTYpewriter. tty is a command to print the file name of the terminal connected to standard input. It's used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
