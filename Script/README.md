# Script

## Subject
> Finally, you have to create a simple script called `monitoring.sh`. It must be developed in `bash`.  
> At server startup, the script will display some information (listed below) on all terminals every 10 minutes (take a look at `wall`). The banner is optional. No error must be visible.  
> Your script must always be able to display the following information:  
> â€¢ The architecture of your operating system and its kernel version.  
> â€¢ The number of physical processors.  
> â€¢ The number of virtual processors.  
> â€¢ The current available RAM on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.  
> â€¢ The current available memory on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.  
> â€¢ The current utilization rate of your processors as a percentage.  
> â€¢ The date and time of the last reboot.  
> â€¢ Whether LVM is active or not.  
> â€¢ The number of active connections.  
> â€¢ The number of users using the server.  
> â€¢ The IPv4 address of your server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address.  
> â€¢ The number of commands executed with the sudo program.

Used commands to check some of the subjectâ€™s requirements:  
`head -n 2 /etc/os-release`  
`/usr/sbin/aa-status`  
`ss-tunlp`  

## Commands
ðŸš¨ You need to install net-tools package to use `netstat` and `ifconfig`!  
`sudo apt install net-tools`  

1. Display the architecture of your operating system and its kernel version.  
2. Display the number of physical processors.
Display the number of virtual processors.
Display the current available RAM on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
Display the current available memory on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
Display the current utilization rate of your processors as a percentage.
Display the date and time of the last reboot.
Display whether LVM is active or not.
Display the number of active connections.
Display the number of users using the server.
Display the IPv4 address of your server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address.
Display the number of commands executed with the sudo program.

## Cron
1. Configure `cron` with `crontab -e` or as root with `sudo crontab -u root -e`.  
2. The script must run every 10 minutes. Add the following lines:  
`@reboot sleep 7.5 && /root/script/monitoring.sh | wall`  
`*/10 * * * * /root/script/monitoring.sh | wall`  
ðŸš¨ You should write the FULL path to file (no ~/*/etc.) to make Cron happy and understand what you're talking about.  
3. Check root's scheduled cron jobs with `sudo crontab -u root -l`.  

4. Sometimes, cron will disregard the output because we haven't set up the "Mail To Address". To disable it, add this line at the top of the crontab:  
```bash   
crontab -e  
  
MAILTO=""  
``` 
So.....  
Crontab file will look like this:  
```bash 
MAILTO=""  
  
@reboot sleep 7.5 && /root/Script/monitoring.sh  
*/10 * * * * /root/Script/monitoring.sh  
``` 

## Cron Commands  
```bash  
sudo systemctl enable cron.service  
sudo systemctl start cron.service  
sudo systemctl stop cron.service  
sudo systemctl restart cron.service  
sudo systemctl status cron.service  
```
