# Script

## Subject
> Finally, you have to create a simple script called `monitoring.sh`. It must be developed in `bash`.  
> At server startup, the script will display some information (listed below) on all terminals every 10 minutes (take a look at `wall`). The banner is optional. No error must be visible.  
> Your script must always be able to display the following information:  
> â€¢ The architecture of your operating system and its kernel version.  
> â€¢ The number of physical processors.  
> â€¢ The number of virtual processors.  
> â€¢ The current available RAM on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.  
> â€¢ The current available memory on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.  
> â€¢ The current utilization rate of your processors as a percentage.  
> â€¢ The date and time of the last reboot.  
> â€¢ Whether LVM is active or not.  
> â€¢ The number of active connections.  
> â€¢ The number of users using the server.  
> â€¢ The IPv4 address of your server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address.  
> â€¢ The number of commands executed with the sudo program.

Used commands to check some of the subjectâ€™s requirements:  
`head -n 2 /etc/os-release`  
`/usr/sbin/aa-status`  
`ss-tunlp`  

## Commands
ðŸš¨ You need to install net-tools package to use `netstat` and `ifconfig`!  

1. The architecture of your operating system and its kernel version.  
`hostnamectl | grep "Operating System" | sed 's/Operating System: //' | sed -e 's/[ \t]*//'`  
`hostnamectl | grep Kernel | sed 's/Kernel: //' | sed -e 's/[ \t]*//'`  
`hostnamectl | grep Architecture | sed 's/Architecture: //' | sed -e 's/[ \t]*//'`  

2. The number of physical and virtual processors.  
`cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "physical id" | sort | uniq | wc -l`  
`cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l`  

3. The current available RAM and memory on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.  
`free -m | grep Mem | awk '{printf("%d/%dMB (%.2f%%)\n", $3, $2, $3/$2 * 100.0}'`  
`df -h / | awk 'NR==2{printf("%s/%s (%d%%)\n", $3, $2, $5)}'`  

4. The date and time of the last reboot.  
`who -b | sed -e 's/system boot//' | sed -e 's/[ \t]*//'`

5. Whether LVM is active or not.
`LVM=$( cat /etc/fstab | grep "/dev/mapper" | wc -l )`  
`if [ $LVM -gt 0 ]`  
`then`  
`echo "#LVM use: yes"`  
`else`  
`echo "#LVM use: no"`  
`fi`

6. The number of active connections.  
`awk </proc/net/tcp 'BEGIN{t=0};{if ($4 == "01") {t++;}};END{print t}'`
or
`netstat -ant | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l`

7. The number of users using the server.  
`who | uniq | wc -l`

8. The IPv4 address of your server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address.  
`apt-get install net-tools`  
`hostname -I` "("`ip address | grep "link/ether" | grep -ioE '([a-z0-9]{2}:){5}..' | head -1`")"`

9. The number of commands executed with the sudo program.
``journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep COMMAND | uniq | wc -l`" cmd" `
