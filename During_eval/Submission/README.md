# Submission and peer-evaluation

You only have to turn in a signature.txt file at the root of your Git repository. You must paste in it the signature of your machine’s virtual disk. To get this signature, you first have to open the default installation folder (it is the folder where your VMs are saved):
MacOS: ~/VirtualBox VMs/

Then, retrieve the signature from the ".vdi" file (or ".qcow2 for UTM’users) of your
virtual machine in sha1 format. Below are 4 command examples for a centos_serv.vdi
file:
MacOS: shasum centos_serv.vdi

This is an example of what kind of output you will get:
