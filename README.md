## General guidelines:
• The use of VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox) is mandatory.
• You only have to turn in a signature.txt file at the root of your repository. You
must paste in it the signature of your machine’s virtual disk. Go to Submission and
peer-evaluation for more information.

## Setting Up Your VM:
"Since it is a matter of setting up a server, you will install the minimum of services. For this reason, a graphical interface is of no user here. It is therefore forbidden to install X.org or any other equivalent graphics server."
--> Deselect Desktop environment and GNOME from software selection during the install in order to get a Debian install without a Graphical User Interface.
